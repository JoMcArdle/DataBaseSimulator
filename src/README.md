Random data for 100 students was generated using https://generatedata.com/generator. 

The site has a tool for generating MYSQL code which was used to populate the Students table with 100 random students.

Random data used to populate the Majors, Minors, IsTaking, and HasTaken tables was done via java program named "DataGeneration" which is included in the src folder along with the main application "App" and the driver class "RunApp".

NOTE: In order to run my main application "App", please use the driver class I created called "Main".
